Flask-Squeeze is a Flask extension that automatically:
- **Minifies** repsonses with the mimetypes javascript and css
- **Compresses** all responses with brotli if the browser supports it, or gzip if the browser supports it!
- **Protects** against the BREACH exploit
- **Caches** static files so that they don't have to be re-compressed. The cache will be cleared each time Flask restarts. Files are considered to be static if they contain ".../static/..." in their request path.

## Compatibility
- Tested with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11

## Installation
```
pip install Flask-Squeeze
```

## Usage
Initialize Flask-Squeeze **BEFORE** all other extensions and after_request handlers! Flask executes after_request handlers in reverse order of declaration, and the compression should be the last step before sending the response.
```python
from flask_squeeze import Squeeze
squeeze = Squeeze()

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    squeeze.init_app(app)
    # Init all other extensions AFTER Flask-Squeeze
    # ...

    return app
```

Thats it! The responses of your Flask app will now get minified and compressed, if the browser supports it.
To control how Flask-Squeeze behaves, the following options exist:

### General options
You can configure Flask-Squeeze with the following options in your [Flask config](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/config/):

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPRESS_FLAG` | `True` | Globally enables or disables Flask-Squeeze |
| `COMPRESS_MIN_SIZE` | `500` | Defines the minimum file size in bytes to activate the compression |
| `COMPRESS_VERBOSE_LOGGING` | `False` | Enable or disable verbose logging. If enabled, Flask-Squeeze will print what it does into the terminal in a highlighted color |
| `COMPRESS_ADD_DEBUG_HEADERS` | `False` | Add debug infos into the response headers, like call durations and cache hit infos. ONLY USE THIS IN DEVELOPMENT.

### Minification options
| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPRESS_MINIFY_CSS` | `True` | Enable or disable css minification using rcssmin |
| `COMPRESS_MINIFY_JS` | `True` | Enable or disable js minification using rjsmin |

### Compression level options
> Static files are chached, so they only have to be compressed once.
> Dynamic files like generated HTML files will not be cached, so they will be compressed for each response.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_BROTLI_STATIC` | `default=11, min=0 , max=11` | Defines the compression level of brotli for static files |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_BROTLI_DYNAMIC` | `default=1, min=0, max=11` | Defines the compression level of brotli for dynamic files |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_DEFLATE_STATIC` | `default=9, min=-1 , max=9` | Defines the compression level of deflate for static files |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_DEFLATE_DYNAMIC` | `default=1, min=-1, max=9` |  Defines the compression level of deflate for dynamic files |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_GZIP_STATIC` | `default=9, min=0 , max=9` | Defines the compression level of gzip for static files |
| `COMPRESS_LEVEL_GZIP_DYNAMIC` | `default=1, min=0, max=9` |  Defines the compression level of gzip for dynamic files |
